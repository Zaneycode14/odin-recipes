    <h3>How to make</h3>
    
    <h4>Making Pizza Dough</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong> Proof the yeast:</strong> </li>

        <p>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy 
        duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm 
        water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast 
        is dissolved.</p>

        <P>After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved 
        completely. The yeast should begin to foam or 
        bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and 
        alive.</p>

        <li><strong>Make and knead the pizza dough:</strong></li>

        <p>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and 
           using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low 
           speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing 
           paddle with the dough hook attachment.</p>
        
        <p>Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed 
            using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.</p>

        <p>If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the 
            ingredients together and knead them by hand.</p>

        <p>The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky 
           to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a 
           little more flour.</p>
        
        <li><strong>Let the dough rise:</strong></li>

        <p>Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside 
           of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the 
           bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated 
           with the oil.</p>

        <p>At this point you can choose how long you want 
           the dough to ferment and rise. A slow 
           fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will 
           result in more complex flavors in the dough. 
           A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm 
           place) will allow the dough to rise 
           sufficiently to work with.</p>
        
        <p>Cover the dough with plastic wrap.</p>

        <p>For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm 
           place (75°F to 85°F) for 1 1/2 hours.</p>
        
        <p>For a medium rise, place the dough in a regular 
           room temperature place (your kitchen counter 
           will do fine) for 8 hours. For a longer rise, 
           chill the dough in the refrigerator for 24 
           hours (no more than 48 hours).</p>
        
        <p>The longer the rise (to a point) the better the 
           flavor the crust will have.</p>
