    <h2>Easy Homemade Soft Pretzels</h2>

    <p>This is one of the easiest ways to prepare homemade 
       soft pretzels and the results are extra delicious. 
       The soft pretzel dough only needs to rest for 10 
       minutes before shaping. The quick baking soda boil 
       gives the pretzels their traditional flavor.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Warm water</li>
        <li>1 Packet yeast</li>
        <li>Melted butter</li>
        <li>Brown or regular granulated sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Flour</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>How to make</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the dough</strong></li>

        <p>Let the yeast foam in the warm water for a few 
            minutes, then add the rest of the ingredients 
            and mix. You can use a stand mixer fitted with 
            a dough hook attachment, a hand mixer, or no 
            mixer at all. Work with what you have in the 
            kitchen.</p>

        <p>Guess what? You don’t have to wait to let this 
           dough rise. YES! Well, we’ll let it rest for 10 
           minutes while you get the baking soda + water 
           boiling on the stove but that’s it.</p>
        
        <li><strong>Shape the soft pretzels</strong></li>

        <p>Roll 1/3 cup of dough into a long 20-22 inch 
           rope. Twist the ends and bring the ends down. 
           Get it into that pretzel shape. And there you
           have it, that’s a pretzel!</p>

        <li><strong>Bake the pretzels</strong></li>

        <p>Now drop the pretzels into the boiling water + 
           baking soda. Let them boil for 20-30 seconds 
           each, then place onto a baking sheet. Sprinkle 
           with salt and bake in a hot oven at 400°F 
           (204°C) for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. 
           </p>
           
        <p>That’s it, you’re done.</p>
